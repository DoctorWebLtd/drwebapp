# Function:
#        Access Control for this smtp server - determines:
#                * Who we accept mail from
#                * Who we accept relaying from
#                * Who we will not send to
#
# Usage:
#        FEATURE(access_db[, type [-o] /etc/mail/access])dnl
#        makemap hash access < access
#
# Format:
#        lhs:
#                email addr              <user@[host.domain]>
#                domain name     unless  FEATURE(relay_hosts_only) is used,
#                        then this is a fqdn - and relay-domains ($=R)
#                        must also be fqdns.
#                network number  must end on an octet boundary, or
#                        you're stuck going the longwinded way ;-{
#        rhs:
#                OK                              accept mail even if other rules in the
#                                                running ruleset would reject it.
#                RELAY                   Allow domain to relay through your SMTP
#                                                server.  RELAY also serves an implicit
#                                                OK for the other checks.
#                REJECT                  reject the sender/recipient with a general
#                                                purpose message that can be customized.
#                                                confREJECT_MSG [550 Access denied] will be issued
#                DISCARD                 discard the message completely using
#                                                the $#discard mailer.
#                ### any text    where ### is an RFC 821 compliant error code
#                                and "any text" is a message to return for
#                        the command
# Examples:
#       spammer@aol.com                 REJECT
#       FREE.STEALTH.MAILER@    550 Spam not accepted
#
# Notes:
#       With FEATURE(blacklist_recipients) this is also possible:
#       badlocaluser                             550 Mailbox disabled for this username
#       host.mydomain.com                        550 That host does not accept mail
#       user@otherhost.mydomain.com  550 Mailbox disabled for this recipient
